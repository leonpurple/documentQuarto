**transitive vs. Intransitive:** A transitive verb requires a direct object to complete its meaning, while an intransitive verb does not. 

For example:

 in the sentence **"I eat an apple"**, **"eat"** is a transitive verb because it has a direct object (**"an apple"**).

 On the other hand, in the sentence **"I sleep" (I sleep), "sleep"** is an intransitive verb because it does not have a direct object.
